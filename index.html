                    <p>Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is Anthony DeFeo. I am a 34-year-old native of Long Island, New York, currently living in Ocala, Florida. 
                    I work at an Amazon warehouse in town, known as TPA6-HTP9, in the outbound department.</p>
                    <p>I have a background in journalism, and I worked for a few newspapers around north and central Florida for about a decade, including 
                    <a class="newslink" href="https://www.beacononlinenews.com">The West Volusia Beacon</a> and <a class="newslink" href="https://www.news-journalonline.com">The Daytona Beach News Journal.</a></p>
                    <p>I am currently taking advantage of Amazon's Career Choice benefit to pursue a new career in front-end web development, 
                    with the help of Correlation One's software development program.</p>

                    <h2>It all started with a surplus computer from the early '80s.</h2>
                    <h4>(with thanks to the Bellmore Union-Free School District)</h4><br>
                    
                    <p>Ever since I was a child, I have taken an interest in computers and technology. My first "personal" computer was a surplus Apple IIe that my family got from what was my elementary school at the time. The IIe dates back to 1983, and we got the computer in the mid-1990s, so it was pretty old by then! It included a green monochrome CRT screen, two 5.25-inch floppy drives (no hard drive!), and a whopping 128KB - yes, kilobytes - of RAM.</p>
                    <p>Like many computers of its era, without a disk inserted, the computer booted to a BASIC prompt. BASIC, as its name implies, is an easy-to-learn programming language that was ubiquitous on early home computers of the late 1970s and 1980s, like the Apple II series and the venerable Commodore 64 and VIC-20.</p>
                    <p>This was my first taste of programming a computer and making it do, line-by-line, what I wanted it to do.</p> 
                    <p>This sparked a lifetime interest in how computers worked and how they could be programmed. If it hadn't been for my early exposure to coding, I don't know if I'd be striving for a career in web development today!</p>
